    "body": "The GitGraph is a tool that visualizes the functional dependencies between python files in a git repository. It generates a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the dependencies between the files. \nThe tool uses the tree-sitter module in Javascript to parse the files and extract the dependencies by creating AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). The graph is then visualized using the d3 library in ReactJS.\n The GitGraph is a powerful tool that can help you to understand the structure of your codebase and identify potential issues. \nIt can be used to analyze the dependencies between files, detect circular dependencies, and identify code smells. The tool is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to customize the visualization and filter the results based on your needs.",

It generates a command for the user based on user needs, it also provides explaination for the command if the user wants to know what the command does, moreover it provides the user to edit the command once its generated and at the end it also provides an option to the user to run the command.\nNaturalShell is a powerful tool that can help you to generate shell commands without having to remember the exact syntax. It can also help you to understand what a command does, and to edit it if necessary. It is a great tool for both beginners and experts who want to work more efficiently in the command line.\n This was my first project built on top of a LLM model and that too a CLI tool.",

We at Eth QF, fund the community for the community.\n This project was focused to help the projects that the majority of the people need, and to increase the fairness in Crowdfunding Flow. Quadratic Funding and CLR matching algorithms are applied to optimise decentralized financing on this platform. reCAPTCHA V2 by Google and OTP Based Authentication is added to prevent Sybil Attacks.",

    "body": "Small business owners often get exploited by moneylenders when borrowing money. High and unfair rates of interest, middlemen, and a process where the entire power lies in the hands of the lender leaves the borrowers vulnerable to exploitation. The entire process is very slow, and requires a lot of manual work.\n We propose a solution to this problem through our DApp Decentralised Financial Peer to Peer Lender based on blockchain technology built on ethereum.\nBorrowers can create their loan proposal with the amount they want, their favourable repayment due date and CID of their mortgage uploaded on IPFS. As of now we are using a decentralised public IPFS gateway. Lender's can verify the borrower's data and send their proposal with their favourable interest rate. Borrower's can choose multiple lenders of their interest. Borrower can repay the loan anytime they want before the due date and amortized loan will be transacted. After the repayment date has passed, borrower cannot repay the loan and their mortgage will be revoked and auctioned off.\n This project was developed to ease the process of peer-to-peer lending and prevent the exploitation of small businesses.",
